# Where am I?

This is a special organization created just to maintain test
github projects to perform git/github tools integration testing.
The names comes as the first association to neverendless and 
pointless battle, which happens inside all of those
repositories - just like in that side mission in WC3 TFT.

We really don't care what's inside and how long do projects live 
(unless there's something illegal), so please send a message to 
dev@ayte.team if you need stuff like this and don't want to 
garbagify your account/organization.
